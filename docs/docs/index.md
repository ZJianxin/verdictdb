# VerdictDB Documentation

## Introduction

VerdictDB is a thin, platform-independent, interactive analytics library that works on top of your existing (or backend) database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, etc.). For platform-independence, VerdictDB makes all communications with the backend database in SQL. For interactive querying, VerdictDB intelligently **infers** the query answers based on the results processed on a part of the original data. Those inferred answers are highly accurate estimators of the exact answers. Furthermore, *even when only exact answers are needed*, VerdictDB can also be useful with its **streaming sql engine**. The streaming sql engine provides interactive-speed feedbacks in the process of computing exact answers. See [this page](/how_it_works/basics) if you want to know more about VerdictDB's internal mechanism.


## Workflow Overview

First, users must create a *scramble* for their large table. The scramble is just some table in a special format. Once the scramble is created, VerdictDB performs its unique operations to quickly process aggregate queries involving the large table.
